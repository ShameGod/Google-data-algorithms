Arrays: allow us to store elements of the same type in memory. It is possible to access each element just by indicating its index.
When creating the array we need to specify its size. 

Linked list: This data structure can grow, since each component contains a value and a pointer to the next value

The draw back of having a dynamic size with linked lists is that we lose random access of elements. To find an element it is necessary to go through all the linked list. The worst case scenario is o(n) which isn't efficient. 

Hash tables : 
this data structure is adapted for insert, delete and lookup opertations :
